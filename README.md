# Covid19-Hospital-Database-Management

Covid-19 hospital database management is a project used to create a database,
using Python MySQL interconnectivity in MySQL workbench on the backend and Python in the front end.
It is a menu-driven interface and different tables in the database can be accessed based on the type of individual.
It uses MySQL.connector, DateTime, and random modules.
We created the project because, during covid times, hospitals used to mismanage the number of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and much more.

The database consists of four tables which can be accessed based on the type of individual

The doctor database can be changed/edited, only by the doctors.

The patient uses the patient database to view their details and store their information.

Outpatients who want to do covid tests see their covid results have their own database.

It also has a covid-19 daily tracker installed, to be viewed by citizens which also has its own database.

The number of oxygen cylinders and no of beds will be overviewed by the government authorities and the information will be stored in the authorities database

The doctor is the only one who is allowed to change their information and add or edit information in all the databases.
